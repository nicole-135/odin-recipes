<h3> Description</h3>
<p> This lasagna is a family favorite and is asked for by my husband and his family. Enjoy the abundance of cheese (ricotta, mozzarella and provolone to be exact) as you cut a hearty slice to serve with a nice side salad or a piece of warm focaccia 
  bread.  
</p>
<p> Enjoy the decadent mixture of sausage, ground beef, tomatoes and fresh herbs that make this sinful yet light American Italian fare.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb. hot italian sausage</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 can (28 oz) whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans (6 oz) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley (divided)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh basil (divided)</li>
        <li>2.5 tsp salt (divided)</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>10 ounces dried lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb sliced mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 lb slice provolone</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain some fo the fat. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 1/2 of the fresh parsley and basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of water to a boil. And pre-heat oven to 350- degrees</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, and the rest of the fresh parsley and basil, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
    <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately:  30 to 40 minutes, or until cheese has melted and browned and bubbly.</li>
