<h3> Description</h3>
<p> This lasagna is a family favorite and is asked for by my husband and his family. Enjoy the abundance of cheese (ricotta, mozzarella and provolone to be exact) as you cut a hearty slice to serve with a nice side salad or a piece of warm focaccia 
  bread.  
</p>
<p> Enjoy the decadent mixture of sausage, ground beef, tomatoes and fresh herbs that make this sinful yet light American Italian fare.
